# Overview

Here we trace the workflow of a developer deploying infrastructure and applications to Azure using Packer, GitHub, Jenkins, Terraform, Vault, Ansible, and Consul. We use our webblog application to demo this.

## Vault Azure Secrets Engine
Let's take a look at how we can build this. You can find details in the [docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/azure). You can also follow the [step-by-step guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/azure-secrets).

Below is a diagram of the Vault Azure Secrets Engine Workflow

### Vault Configuration

The configuration setup below needs to be done by a Vault Admin. The [Vault policy](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/azure-secrets#policy-requirements) `Vault/policies/azure_admin_policy.hcl` is used with a token to run the configuration commands. We use the root token in this demo for simplicity, however, in a production setting it's not recommended to use the root token.

We are re-using our existing Vault cluster. The Vault admin configuration is located in the [infrastructure-gcp GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/public-projects3/infrastructure-gcp/-/tree/master/terraform-vault-configuration)

#### Setup

Below an admin uses the Vault Terraform Provider. This is found in the [main.tf file](https://gitlab.com/public-projects3/infrastructure-gcp/-/blob/master/terraform-vault-configuration/main.tf)

```
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myresourcegroup" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-jenkins"
  location = var.location
}

resource "vault_azure_secret_backend" "azure" {
  subscription_id = var.subscription_id
  tenant_id = var.tenant_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
  client_id = var.client_id
}

resource "vault_azure_secret_backend_role" "jenkins" {
  backend                     = vault_azure_secret_backend.azure.path
  role                        = "jenkins"
  ttl                         = 300
  max_ttl                     = 600

  azure_roles {
    role_name = "Contributor"
    scope =  "/subscriptions/${var.subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup.name}"
  }
}
```

### Request Azure Creds Manually

```shell
vault policy write jenkins Vault/policies/jenkins_azure_policy.hcl
vault token create -policy=jenkins
VAULT_TOKEN=xxxxxx vault read azure/creds/jenkins
```

### Packer to Build a Jenkins Image in Azure

- Install Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, Ansible

When using the Azure creds, I can't use the ones generated by Vault because they are specific to the `samg-jenkins` resource group. Packer for some reason uses a random Azure resource group when building therefore it needs creds that have a scope for any resource group. I use the regular service principal creds.

### Terraform to Build a Jenkins VM in Azure

Here I can use the Vault generated creds to build a VM in Azure since the creds are tied to the `samg-jenkins` resource group.

### Use an App Role
